The villagers do their best to celebrate the evening with candles and hearts alight, providing refuge for you and your party among warm fire and company. However, despite the festivities, something darker than the night itself seems to loom ominously over the evening, and the festivities are soon interrupted by corrupted beings of unknown origin. You must venture against the coming storm and the growing darkness to save the people of Tahm's Praerie from the unspeakable evil's of Krampus and his dastardly minions.</em></p><h2>Credits</h2><h4><strong>Lead Developer</strong></h4><p>Tony Saunders</p><h4><strong>Development Team</strong></h4><p>Ediwir</p><p>Helen Savore</p><h4><strong>Writing Team</strong></h4><p>Cameron Lyndon</p><p>Ediwir</p><p>Tony Saunders</p><p>Rico the Bold</p><h4><strong>Editorial Team</strong></h4><p>Helen Savore</p><p>Tony Saunders</p><h4><strong>VTT Development &amp; Maps</strong></h4><p>Christopher Yang</p><p>Sam Marine</p><h4><strong>Artwork</strong></h4><p>Derry Luttrell</p><p>Shawn Pommier (page background)</p><h4><strong>Formatting &amp; Layout</strong></h4><p>Shawn Pommier</p>","actors":[{"name":"Courtyard Snowman","type":"npc","ownership":{"default":0,"TfmgFHVW2clJolAG":3,"2tKz6kU69eoI9Zxj":3,"jVYw2xBXR4Z8ch0S":3},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":false}},"height":2,"width":2,"name":"Courtyard Snowman","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/the-longnight-before-krampus/img/tokens/Snowman.webp","scaleX":1.1,"scaleY":1.1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"randomImg":false},"img":"modules/the-longnight-before-krampus/img/art/Snowman.webp","system":{"attributes":{"hp":{"value":45,"temp":0,"max":45,"details":""},"initiative":{"ability":"perception"},"speed":{"value":25,"otherSpeeds":[],"details":""},"ac":{"value":19,"details":""},"perception":{"value":9},"allSaves":{"value":""}},"details":{"alignment":{"value":"N"},"level":{"value":3},"source":{"value":"","author":""},"creatureType":"","blurb":"","publicNotes":"","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["cold","construct","mindless"],"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["bleed","cold","death-effects","disease","doomed","drained","electricity","fatigued","healing","mental","necromancy","nonlethal-attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"physical","value":4,"exceptions":""}],"dv":[{"type":"fire","value":4,"exceptions":""}],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T21:11:26.215+00:00","version":{"schema":0.802,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":0},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":-5},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":-5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":7,"saveDetail":""}}},"items":[{"name":"Athletics","type":"lore","system":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T21:11:26.215+00:00","version":{"schema":0.802,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"mod":{"value":12},"proficient":{"value":0}},"_id":"5u4VeouB2NXsyZry","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"TfmgFHVW2clJolAG":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670529758906,"modifiedTime":1670529762896,"lastModifiedBy":"TfmgFHVW2clJolAG"}},{"type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Let It Snow","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>At the end of each turn the snowman is exposed to snapping cold it heals [[/r {1d6} ]]{1d6 Hit Points}.

Yah is a little sore that our gift isn’t as well received, but I think that’s the magic of Longnight. I remember staying up past the smallwick for toys. That’s part of the fun.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>What is the ‘smallwick’?</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>Old tradition for us on Longnight. We light a candle for each day of the moon cycle. The thirtieth candle is half as big to represent the half-day in the cycle. If little children stay awake past the smallwick, they get to open a present. Hal is determined to stay up past the smallwick this time. He deserves a good Longnight. *sniffle*</p></blockquote><p>If the players attempt to Sense Motive on Pamela at a @Check[type:perception|dc:15|traits:action:sense-motive], they notice she is distressed.</p><h4><em><strong>Everything okay?</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>Is it that obvious? My landlord is being less than reasonable. It’s been a slow year and these storms haven’t helped. We normally are all booked up for Longnight, but sadly, that won’t be the case this year. That awful witch only worsens things when they get together. Always trying to impress her. Giving her a free room of all things while telling me payment is due before the week is out. Victor seeks to court the winter witch for status, but Ida is a business woman first and foremost. Cold. They left some time ago, and I’m ashamed to say, I hope the storm is unkind to them.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>Tell me about Baig and Abraham.</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>Those two dwarves make me have hope for Yah and I. Been together for over 100 years and they are such different people, but truly wonderful in their own right. They moved up here from the south for work. Baig is a wonderful baker, so I do hope he and Abraham stay.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>Tell me about Ida Bouzahd.</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>I don’t know her, but she’s not much of a guest and she likes ale. She roams Irrisen as she pleases. She makes baked goods with a special freezing technique that leaves them moist. She owns a chain of bakeries across Irrisen, like the bakery adjoined to us. Poor Baig, she’s got him working late so he can make his cookies for her festivities on the morrow. He’s still over there. Poor Abraham was so furious over the whole thing. They love this holiday, one day off he gets from the smithy.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>Tell me about Victor Shunning.</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>Heartless. That’s all I can say. We’ve been here since Hal was but a wish. After all the years I kept this place open, I feel so betrayed. My husband almost seems happy to be out from under Victor’s thumb, but I love this town and I love this place. I haven’t found the words for Hal yet. He has so many friends here. I want him to have a good last Longnight in our home. *sniffle*</p></blockquote><p>After Pamela has been asked about Victor, she will wipe her tears, put on a smile, and ask the players to prepare for the dinner her husband is cooking.</p><h4><strong>Hal Purr</strong></h4><p>The young half-elf boy sits staring at the smallwick on the mantle, which is only just beginning to flicker as it approaches the stump of wax at its base. If the players try to engage with him, he answers simple questions but is ultimately too distracted by the prospect of opening his presents.</p><h4><em><strong>Hi there.</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>Just a few… more… minutes. (looking at smallwick)</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>Abraham Erhman and Visteel Kutzguud</strong></em></h4><p>Two dwarves sit bellowing about their daily crafts, and how children these days are so impatient as they sip ale with hearty laughs and pulls of their beards. If the players succeed at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:10|traits:action:request]{Request} to sit with them or bring another ale from Pamela’s bar, they engage with the players, but otherwise keep to themselves.</p><h4><em><strong>(Both) How’s it going?</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>(Visteel) I can’t complain. (Abraham) Well I can. I want my Longnight cookies. How many did that witch possibly need? *grumble* (Visteel) None of that now. Poor Trad got stuck at the smithy tonight, so the whole town has caught the ‘work to live’ mentality. (Abraham) That’s true. Torag knows you wouldn’t catch me dead in that smithy by myself. Too dangerous. Remember the accident a few months back? Poor fella lost their hand. Trad’s braver than me, even if he is a little thief.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>(Both) Tell me about Trad</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>(Abraham) He’s a tool thief. But he’s okay. (Visteel) I don’t think he means it. Just bad memory these days. He’s been working in that smithy a long time, way before Hans came to manage it. Believe it or not said its almost as dangerous to work there now as it was when Baba Yaga ruled.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>(Both) Tell me about Hans.</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>(Abraham) Hans shows up one every two weeks to collect the materials we refine for the capital before he traipse back off to wherever it is that he goes. (Visteel) He said he’d fix the forges. (Abraham) He says that every time he comes. He skims, I swear it. Capital pays him to maintain the shipments, and you know some of that is supposed to go to maintaining the factory. Last thing he fixed was that door months ago, and the locks already broke again.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>(To Abraham) Why is Baig not here?</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>(Abraham) Ida is relentless. Baig has been the talk of the town for his cookies, but is that enough for her? Of course not. He said it would only take him a few hours, but it’s been three. Part of me hopes he was baking an extra batch. Doesn’t matter how many I eat, I still can’t get enough *pats his stomach*</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>(To Visteel) What brings you here?</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>I’m just keeping an eye on Abe here. That and looking out for Krampus. He’s going to come here and swoop up this little tot who can’t take his eyes off the candle!</p></blockquote><p>If Visteel is given a chance to make his claim about Krampus, the small boy Hal will claim Krampus isn’t real and that his mom told him so.

The krampy will deploy a Mischievous Trap on its first turn in front of the kitchen door. The next person who moves through the door will trigger the trap, including Yah, who will leave the room to investigate if the gunpowder bear starts a fire. Once the trap is triggered, the krampy will then attack the creature snared until it is threatened, at which point it will attempt to flee to the second floor (@UUID[.MrPaTLrZYUoo45te]{A3}).

I believe I shall be taking guardianship of them.” He then grows, his fur coats becoming an actual fur, black scraggly and covered in who knows what.

Tell me, truly, that you are not here for your own ends…?”</p></blockquote><p>If your party has not already realized it, you should reveal the Stranger is Krampus. This is also their opportunity to convince the Krampus there is good in this town.</p><p>He will ask the players <em>“Why should I spare this town?”</em> to which the players must make their arguments and they are judged for their Longnight Spirit. If their arguments are well reasoned, the GM can choose to award the players additional Longnight Spirit points.</p><h4><strong>Received less than 4 Longnight Spirit Points per player</strong></h4><blockquote><p>“I’ll leave the girl, but that still leaves the matter of how naughty you’ve been. Allow me to welcome you to my lair in the north.” The party is then turned into krampy’s, like the 4 krampies they encountered during the adventure.</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Received more than 4 but less than 8 Longnight Spirit Points per player</strong></h4><blockquote><p>“Perhaps there is some good in people, but I will return to test this town again.” Krampus disappears leaving behind a howl of laughter.</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Received more than 8 Longnight Spirit Points per player</strong></h4><p>Krampus will grimace and say, <em><strong>“Impossible!

Tavern} where you can read the following epilogue according to how the players did. You might need to alter it according to how the adventure progressed (such as describing makeshift repairs in the event the Tavern is damaged by fire), but the general sentiment should always be a happy one.</p><blockquote><p>As you enter the tavern, you see smiling faces huddled together by the fire. Pamela quickly comes to the door and wraps Isolde in a blanket and hugs her and Armand. Hal, the young boy, runs to hug them both as well and offers Isolde a turn playing with his carved toy duck calling it his ‘new favorite toy’, and although Isolde at first recoils, she takes it reluctantly and then smiles. Armand hands Pamela a sack of gold and tells her that he heard the tavern was struggling, and he said he would like to buy a room for as long as ‘this’ will get him. Pamela will smile, look at Yah (who nods), and says “Forever and always.” Armand hands his sister the cookie from her father with her name on it, she eats it. She will smile, wipe away some tears, and then hug her brother as she whispers ‘I love you too’. Armand and Isolde thank you and say ‘Lovely Longnight’.</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>If Baig was saved</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>Abraham is singing Longnight tunes while holding Baig in his lap rocking side to side with glee. Baig is smiling and asks ‘Do you want me to make some more cookies?’, as he attempts to stand up, but is hugged tighter by Abe in protest, ‘I’ve got all I need right here!’</p></blockquote><h4><em><strong>If Trad was saved</strong></em></h4><blockquote><p>Visteel slaps Trad on the back and says ‘When are you going to give me my tools back?’ to which Trad responds, ‘I’ll do you one better, you can have all my tools too. As of tomorrow morning, I quit!’ The two will share a laugh and clank glasses together. Visteel asks Trad, ‘What will you do now?’, and Trad will look over at the kids playing with toys and say ‘I think I’d like to make something that makes people smile.’</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>You enjoy the remainder of the evening in the tavern and sigh with relief as the crack of dawn greets you that morning.</p></blockquote><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":"qD3mjDWGCdLir1s7","sort":103125,"ownership":{"default":0,"2tKz6kU69eoI9Zxj":3,"jVYw2xBXR4Z8ch0S":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670812083347,"modifiedTime":1671316306557,"lastModifiedBy":"jVYw2xBXR4Z8ch0S"},"_id":"xC5aYJ6ziaCVtiY1"},{"folder":"qD3mjDWGCdLir1s7","name":"0.

Each section of the adventure will provide game masters and players moments for engaging in the spirit of the season, while offering opportunities to tailor the adventure to their party’s specific holiday traditions. Players are encouraged to make characters that fit holiday themes and explore concepts that would otherwise be out of place in other games. This adventure, like most published adventures, is presented as a series of areas to explore and challenges to face.</p><p>Whenever the heroes enter a new area of the map, refer to the section in this book that corresponds to the letter on the map. Each entry begins with a brief introduction so you know what to expect, followed by text set in green for you to read aloud. The rest of the area’s text includes all the information you need about what the heroes will come across in this area. This text contains spoilers—it gives you information about the challenges the heroes face as they explore the area. If the area includes combat, traps, hazards, or treasure, the rules for those are in this text. As they move through the town, the players will use their heroes’ skills and abilities to explore the area and overcome its obstacles. It’s likely they’ll have questions and try actions that aren’t covered by the rules in this book. As the GM, you get to make up the answers and decide what happens, but always try to be fair, and remember that the goal of the game is for everyone to have a fun time. You should encourage the heroes to try things in the spirit of the game and to engage in holiday antics. If the players get stuck or confused about what to do next, you can give them a few hints or ideas to get them started. The players have roughly 12 hours to complete the adventure before dawn breaks and Longnight is over, after which the storm ends and players are judged based on their Longnight Spirit if they do not reach the final conclusion.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Once each player has created or been given a character, the game can begin. Once everyone is ready to begin, start by reading the text below to set the scene.</p><blockquote><p>Our adventurers find themselves in the far reaches of the Irrisen province of Wintercrux. The tumultuous weather has forced our adventurers to take shelter in the small town of Tahm’s Praerie, but they find themselves welcomed by the villagers who are celebrating Longnight by candlelight indoors. In the tavern, they find merry spirits that bid them hello with good ale and food close at hand. Candles line the front counter of the tavern to celebrate the season, and behind it stands a jovial elf named Pamela Purr, the manager of the establishment. In the serving area there is a kitchen counter window where Yah, Pam’s husband and the tavern chef, can be seen dressing a boar for the evening's festivities. Two dwarves sit in the serving area, dusting off the fatigue from their day at the town Smithy as they grumble to each other about a hard day's work and warm themselves by the fireplace with generous amounts of ale. The serving area has many tables, each decorated with a single white serving tray to symbolize the full moon. By the far wall is a tall pine dressed with an assortment of baubles that glow, and beneath it are two wrapped boxes presumably for the children vigilant enough to see the smallwick burn out to its end. The mantle of the fireplace is lined with candles, a total of thirty candles with the traditional final candle being half the length of the others. Hal, the half-elf son of Pam and Yah, stares eagerly at the waning wax of the thirtieth candle while the dwarves tell their stories, hoping no doubt that the smallwick runs out so he can open his presents.</p></blockquote><p>After you finish reading, have the players introduce their heroes to one another, including their name, ancestry, background, and class. Players might also want to describe what their hero looks like, what kind of gear they carry, and maybe a bit about their personality. You can also show them the picture of @Actor[sBNrdGYb20CsnuMQ]{Pamela Purr}, @Actor[DGr90rLAdDVVXoUs]{Yah Purr}, and @Actor[G2iiA056CMZVMFR3]{Hal Purr}. After the introductions, have the players place their pawns somewhere in the tavern serving area or main hall.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"2tKz6kU69eoI9Zxj":3,"jVYw2xBXR4Z8ch0S":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671225145752,"modifiedTime":1671316306558,"lastModifiedBy":"jVYw2xBXR4Z8ch0S"},"_id":"fYWOF1mWiG4zZzmR"}],"scenes":[{"name":"Orphanage","grid":{"size":60,"type":1,"color":"#000000","alpha":0.2,"distance":5,"units":"ft"},"width":1560,"height":1500,"padding":0.25,"background":{"src":"modules/the-longnight-before-krampus/img/scenes/orphanage.webp","offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"active":false,"navigation":true,"navOrder":0,"navName":"","foreground":null,"foregroundElevation":20,"thumb":"worlds/krampus/assets/scenes/Kgj2xly5O3Kdcl2z-thumb.webp","initial":{"x":null,"y":null,"scale":null},"backgroundColor":"#999999","tokenVision":true,"fogExploration":true,"fogReset":1670244541994,"globalLight":false,"globalLightThreshold":null,"darkness":1,"fogOverlay":null,"fogExploredColor":null,"fogUnexploredColor":null,"drawings":[],"tokens":[{"name":"Snowfall","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/hazard.svg","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":false}},"actorId":"70Pv8J3CfZIQVrSE","x":1260,"y":1440,"hidden":true,"_id":"RAdLbpjHqIZoz8zf","actorData":{},"elevation":0,"effects":[],"overlayEffect":""},{"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"height":1,"width":1,"name":"Springjaw
