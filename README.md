<h1>The Longnight Before Krampus</h1>
<p><em>While Irrisen is no stranger to winter storms and tumultuous weather, the town of Tahm's Praerie finds their normal Longnight festivities barred to the indoors on account of an unprecedented storm. The villagers do their best to celebrate the evening with candles and hearts alight, providing refuge for you and your party among warm fire and company. However, despite the festivities, something darker than the night itself seems to loom ominously over the evening, and the festivities are soon interrupted by corrupted beings of unknown origin. You must venture against the coming storm and the growing darkness to save the people of Tahm's Praerie from the unspeakable evil's of Krampus and his dastardly minions.</em></p>
